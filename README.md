The basic code to perform kinetic modelling and to generate model-based input functions is provided. Its basic components are:

The Model1CXM_PET, Model2CXM_PETM, ModelSRTM_PET and ModelFullRTM_PET codes are the functions responsible to perform 
1-compartmental, 2-compartmental, simplified reference tissue and full reference tissue kinetic modelling, respectively.

The "residual" components implement the nonlinear model fitting for each model. 

The PrepareComAIF calculated the model-based input function, by using standard (estimated) values for K1聞 (=0.29 ml/min/ml) and 
k2聞 (=0.11 1/min). 
These values can be modified accordingly for different studies, by adding your estimated or literature values for K1聞 and k2聞.  

Finally, the CreateExponDecay code performs exponential decay between phases 1 and 2, as mathematically described in our manuscript.
